# HCA Code Test

## Objective
A front end code test for the HCA Experience and Innovation team.

## Build Page Checklist
Please include the following items in your code:
- Bootstrap 3 or 4 library for structure and styling
- Make sure the page design/content is responsive
- A navigation bar
- Multiple headings to show use of the HTML header hierarchy
- At least one button
- At least one glyphicon (the icons available in Bootstrap) and add a hover effect
- An address and phone number (doesnâ€™t have to be real contact information)
- Include one of the following Bootstrap 3 or 4 components:
*Pick one of these two and trigger it using vanilla JavaScript (not data attributes and no jQuery, although we recognize jQuery is included as a BootStrap dependency):*
    - Carousel
    - Modal
    - Collapse
- Tweak something in your chosen component, such as:
    - Change the default transition speed of the carousel
    - Change the default fade effect of the modal or collapse
- All three of the following features of the Less or Sass languages:
    - Variable
    - Mixin
    - Import
- Host your website so our non-developer team members can see your work (GitHub Pages is a great, free hosting solution for static sites)
- Git
    - We are looking for common best practices, like working in branches and merging into master.  
    - Be prepared to explain your git workflow choices (i.e. commit message format, squashing commits, rebasing, any other choices you make)
